* `context`: The context to act upon.

## `T:Inversion.Web.Behaviour.RenderBehaviour`

#### Remarks
This is basically a filtering of the  [Inversion.Process.ProcessContext.ControlState](P-Inversion.Process.ProcessContext.ControlState)  into             the model called the view state, that is going to be rendered. Any item in the control state with a key             starting with the underscore character '_' is regarded as protected, and will             not be copied forward to the view state.

If one wished to present a model for render by different means, or wanted to change how the filtering was done, this is the behaviour you would swap out for an alternate implementation.

* `ev`: The event that gave rise to this action.
* `context`: The context within which this action is being performed.

## `T:Inversion.Web.Behaviour.View.JsonViewBehaviour`

## `T:Inversion.Web.Behaviour.View.RazorViewBehaviour`
A web behaviour that resolves razor templates to generate views.

#### Remarks
Razor isn't getting a lot of attention in Inversion initially, at some point I'll pay it some attention, but it's really not a priority as personally I'm not a big fan.

Razor is the fast food of templating. It's really tasting and super-saturated with utility, and it's bad for you. When rendering a view you really shouldn't be able to yield side-effects, and you shouldn't be able to consider anything other than the view you're rendering. In Razor you can do anything you want. And you will. Especially when people aren't looking.

Worse, you'll start architecting clever helpers, and mappings, and... you'll start refactoring, and all your templates will become enmeshed in one glorious front-end monolith.

Razor. Just say "no"... Okay, I'm over-egging it a bit.

Joking aside, I get why Razor is so popular. It's simple, bendy, easy for .NET devs to dive into, and you can brute force yourself out of any situation. It does however in my view encourage poor practice and blurs an important application layer so the middle and front of the application risk becoming quickly enmeshed.

Conclave favours XML/XSL, I understand why you might not, hence  [Inversion.Web.Behaviour.View.RazorViewBehaviour](T-Inversion.Web.Behaviour.View.RazorViewBehaviour) .
